# React Native with Expo Installation Guide

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps to install React Native with Expo, a framework that simplifies the development process of React Native applications. Expo provides a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and managing React Native projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Alternative package manager for Node.js) or
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (Command Line Interface for Expo)

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the React Native repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fikrifyanto/herca-mobile.git herca_mobile
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once you have cloned the React Native repository, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

```bash
cd herca_mobile
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 4: Run the Project

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can run the app on an emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to view the app in real-time.

### Conclusion

You have successfully installed React Native with Expo and created a new project using Yarn! For more information and in-depth documentation, please refer to the Expo Documentation and React Native Documentation.
